# Verivis PoI MVP

**Proof of Inference Protocol – Minimal Viable Product**

A zk-SNARK based protocol for cryptographic attestation of medical AI inferences in nuclear medicine (Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT).

## Project Status (March 2026)
- ✅ In-Silico simulation completed (U-Net on synthetic Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT slices)
- ✅ Anchor smart contract successfully built and ready for deployment
- ✅ Public GitHub repository live
- ✅ Live interactive demo available on website

## Core Technology
- Groth16 zk-SNARK proof generation for execution integrity
- On-chain anchoring of proof hashes
- Designed specifically for clinical workflows and PACS integration
