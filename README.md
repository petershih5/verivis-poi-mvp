# Verivis PoI MVP

**Proof of Inference Protocol - Minimal Viable Product**

A zk-SNARK based protocol for cryptographic attestation of medical AI inferences in nuclear medicine.

## Project Status
- ✅ In-Silico simulation completed (U-Net on synthetic Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT)
- ✅ Anchor smart contract deployed to Solana Devnet (Milestone 1)
- ✅ Public GitHub repository

## Core Features
- Groth16 zk-SNARK proof generation for medical AI execution integrity
- On-chain anchoring of proof hashes on Solana
- Designed for clinical workflows (PACS integration ready)

## Quick Start
```bash
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
